## About 

### What is Zdog?

"[Zdog](https://zzz.dog/) is a 3D JavaScript engine for <canvas> and [SVG](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/SVG). With Zdog, you can design and render simple 3D models on the Web. Zdog is a pseudo-3D engine. Its geometries exist in 3D space, but are rendered as flat shapes. This makes Zdog special.

Zdog is friendly. Modeling is done with a straight-forward declarative API.
Zdog was designed to bring the simplicity of vector illustration into 3D. Drawing circles and squares is easy and fun. Zdog just adds another dimension."
